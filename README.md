# LAB 06: - Self-Driving Cars + Static Method

_Learning Objective: demonstrate the fundamentals of defining/calling static methods by debriefing on the article reading._

You'll be using your answers for the guiding questions from reading the articles on the ethics of self-driving cars, here are the questions again:

- Should a self-driving car prioritize the safety of its passengers or pedestrians?
- What factors should the car's algorithms consider when making such determinations?
- Who should be deciding the algorithms for self-driving cars?

## Part 1: Creating Method Definition ##

Create a void method that prints out your thoughts and responses from the article reading.

## Part 2: Invoking/Calling Method ##

To test your method, invoke the method you created inside of `main`

## Part 3: Identifying elements of the method ##

Use code comments to identify the following elements of your method definition:

- method header
- method body
- return type
- method identifier
